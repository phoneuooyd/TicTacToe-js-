# Simple TicTacToe game
That is the effect of my first take on web app development. 
I made this just for fun and to expand my knowledge, I hope i will turn it some day in some multiplayer app.

- Basics:

  ```
  The app runs a constant while loop that counts steps - odd ticks are for player 1, even ticks are for player 2.
  As long as the grids are not filled, the loop is working. The "new game" button does what it sounds it does.
